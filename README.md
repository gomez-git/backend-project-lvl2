# Annotation
This is my second JavaScript project based on Hexlet backend courses. I build a difference generator for flat json and yaml files.

You can use it as a script in termanal or as a library in your JavaScript project.
## How to install
```
git clone git@github.com:gomez-git/backend-project-lvl2.git
cd backend-project-lvl2
make install
```
